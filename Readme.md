There is 6 files in this repository :
  - train.parquet and value.parquet are the dataset that we are using
  - vectorization_model.ipynb is a jupiter note book file that aim to determine the best vectorize methods for Multi-Label Classification
  - architecture_model.ipynb is a jupiter note book file that aim to determine the best classification methods for Multi-Label Classification
  - hybrid.ipynj is a jupiter note book file that, based on the result of the two first files, aim to create a model that combine all the best model of classification and vectoriaztion in one in order to have the best possible result
  - Ma412_report.pdf is my report on this project
